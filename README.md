A voxel cone tracing implementation for real-time global illumination. 
Voxel cone tracing is used to create effects such as transparency (by refraction), reflections (diffuse and specular) and soft shadows.
The implementation traces cones through a 3D texture. The 3D texture represents a directly lit voxelized scene.
